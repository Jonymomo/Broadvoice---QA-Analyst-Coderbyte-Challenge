Questions I should ask to clarify requirements:

1.1 - What to do when the first or the last name has fewer than 6 characters or more than 30 characters? 

1.2 - Why does the first and last name need to have between 6 and 30 characters, but the varchar for the firstname is 10 and for the last name is 12? What happens to first names between 11 and 30 characters or last names between 12 and 30 characters?

1.3 - How long does the temporary password remain valid before the user is required to change it? Are there special requirements for the new password entered by the user (e.g., special caracters, uppercase, lowercase)?

1.4 - What specific actions should be done if the system exceeds the 3-second user creation time limit? Should it display an error, retry the operation or another action is required ?
